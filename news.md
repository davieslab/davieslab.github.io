<p>Robbie and colleagues published "Using common genetic variation to examine phenotypic expression and risk prediction in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome" in Nature Medicine. Investigating a cohort of 962 individuals with 22q11DS, this study had two main objectives. First, to examine the shared genetic basis between schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related early trajectory phenotypes. Second, in this population at elevated risk ofÂ schizophrenia and intellectual disability, to evaluate the use of polygenic scores for individual risk prediction.

<p>Marcus joins the lab as a co-supervised student. Marcus is co-supervised by Gil McVean, who recently left the University of Oxford to work at Genomics plc full time. Marcus' work investigates the transferability of linkage disequilibrium, and other population genetic statistics, across diverse populations. This work is motivated in the context of GWAS studies to better analyse summary statistics, for example through better summary statistic imputation.</p>

<p>Luis joins the lab, having completed one year as a SABS DPhil student and passing his initial SABS viva. Luis is co-supervised by Simon, as well as Satu and Tony from Roche. Luis will investigate genetic heterogeneity in ASD with a goal of stratifying individuals into those most likely to respond to specific interventions.</p>
