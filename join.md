There are a variety of well funded programs available at the University of Oxford that fund doctoral work at the intersection of statistics, genetics and medicine. More information about the various programs and centres for doctoral training (CDTs) are given <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/study-here/research-degrees/" class = "link">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-genomic-medicine-and-statistics" class="link">here</a>. Particularly relevant programs are GMS, SABS, StatML, Health Data Science, and directly through the Department of Statistics. Students already on a doctoral program interested in undertaking research in the lab are invited to get in touch to discuss shared research interests.

There is no available post-doctoral funding at this time, but please get in contact if you think there is a good research fit and you have ideas about funding.
