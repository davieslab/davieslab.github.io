<h3>Robert Davies</h3>
</header>
<p>I am an associate professor in Statistical and Population Genomics at the Department of Statistics in the University of Oxford. I have diverse interests within statistical genetics but particularly enjoy research into challenging statistical problems applied to large datasets that will ultimately contribute to the potential to predict phenotype from genotype with a view towards eventual clinical application. Before starting in Oxford, I spent two years at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow, and before that, worked for Genomics plc for a year and a half. I received my DPhil in the GMS program at Oxford, and have a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Ottawa. Each of these research and work experiences has been primarily in statistical genetics.</p>
